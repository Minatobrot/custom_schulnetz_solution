# Schulnetz Grades Extraction - Complete Guide

## Overview
This Godot application now supports **real grades extraction** from your Schulnetz account using a JavaScript-based method. No more placeholder data!

## Quick Start (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Run the App
1. Open the Schulnetz app in Godot
2. Click "ðŸ“‹ EXTRACT GRADES" button in the main menu
3. This will generate the JavaScript extraction code

### Step 2: Manual Grade Extraction
1. Open your web browser
2. Login to your Schulnetz account
3. Navigate to the grades page (Noten/Bewertungen)
4. Open Developer Console (F12)
5. Copy and paste the JavaScript code from the extraction script
6. Press Enter - a JSON file will download automatically

### Step 3: Import Your Grades
1. Save the downloaded JSON file as `latest_grades.json`
2. Place it in your app's data directory (shown in the app)
3. Restart the app - your real grades will appear!

## File Locations

### App Data Directory
```
Windows: C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\Godot\app_userdata\Schulnetz App\data\
```

### Required Files
- `latest_grades.json` - Your extracted grades data
- `extraction_script.js` - Generated JavaScript code
- `INSTRUCTIONS.txt` - Detailed instructions

## JavaScript Extraction Method

The app generates a JavaScript function that:
1. Extracts student information (name, class)
2. Parses the grades table on the Schulnetz page
3. Collects subject codes, names, grades, and confirmation status
4. Downloads the data as a formatted JSON file

### Example Extracted Data
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-07-18T15:30:00.000Z",
  "student": {
    "name": "Max Mustermann",
    "class": "M2a"
  },
  "subjects": [
    {
      "code": "MA-M2a-BuA",
      "name": "Mathematik",
      "grade": "5.5",
      "confirmed": "Ja"
    },
    {
      "code": "DE-M2a-MaN",
      "name": "Deutsch",
      "grade": "4.0",
      "confirmed": "Ja"
    }
  ]
}
```
